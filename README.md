# PUI2015_lmcleod
Principles of Urban Informatics CUSP 2015

To set up my environment
I opened .bashprofile through the terminal using nano and added an export line to set a permenant variable with the path to my PUI2015 folder.
I then added an alias that would change my directory to the PUI2015 directory using the cd command and the variable I had just created.
